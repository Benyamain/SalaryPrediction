# Salary Prediction ðŸ’¸

A demo showcasing a web-based machine learning model that predicts the salary of an individual based on specific parameters such as a developer's place of residence, years of experience, and education level. Finding the right model and fine-tuning it was done on Jupyter Notebook. The model was trained on the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer dataset. The web-based portion of the project was made possible through streamlit. Coded all in python :)

Note: The classifier used that best represented this data was with a GridSearchCV in combination with a Decision Tree Regressor.
